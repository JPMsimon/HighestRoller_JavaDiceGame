Instructions for “WHO’S THE HIGHEST ROLLER?” :

User vs. Computer dice game. You'll be playing against your conscience as represented by the computer (--sssh! It's a scenario. Just play along). The digit each player earns for each tossing round is added to the next one until they complete all five rounds. The player with the highest added total by the fifth round is the winner.

How to run the game:

Go to https://github.com/JPMsimon/HighestRoller_JavaDiceGame and download all the files in the folder. Instead of downloading the .java file, you may also simply open it and copy the codes. The game has an image embedded in it, so you might want to download the .gif image first to prevent any errors if you’re not downloading the whole folder from my github repository. Open your IDE of choice on your computer and paste the code on your console. Don’t forget to load the .gif image that you have just downloaded, too. Run the code and wait for the game to load. Play as many rounds as you’d like, or just choose “No” to terminate the game.
